## Deploying to Docker Swarm
Deploy 100 containers with each running our go binary, and name it 'test-cluster':

```sh
$ docker service create --replicas 100 --name test-cluster yevshev/emulator-push

# We can provide addtional parameters as needed
```
Additional docker service [commands](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/service/
):
```sh
# List running docker services
$ docker service ls

# Display detailed information on the service
$ docker service inspect test-cluster --pretty

# Scale our service to 1000 containers
$ docker service scale test-cluster=1000

# Remove the service
$ docker service rm test-cluster

# stop all running containers
$ docker stop $(docker ps -a -q)

# Delete all containers
$ docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)
```
